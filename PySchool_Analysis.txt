After reviewing the various data sets for  PySchools, there are a few deductions that we can make. For one, it appears that charter schools are, by and large, more succesful than district schools. Charter school students outperformed district students in every single academic category that was analyzed. The top five schools with the highest overall passing rate were Charter schools, while the lowest were all district schools. Another conclusion that I drew was schools with over 2000 students performed poorly on average across the board academically, which may be because those students do not get the same one on one interaction and attention with their teachers as smaller schools. Lastly, it didn't appear that school spending played any significant role in success of students. While it's often assumed that the more funding schools get, the better those students will score, our data actually proved money spent was an insignificant factor.
